### The doggo generator website generates a random image of a selected breed and random(mostly for fun) facts about the dog.

My learning was focused on making a website that generates an image from the dogceo API and shows a random description of the dog. 

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would create different tabs to show multiple images of a selected breed.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that a project will always need improvements and a due date is a must.
